## How to build apps 

### Using CocoaPods

1. Run "pod install" or "pod update" in the application's root directory to install
   the HERE SDK.

2. In the "General" settings of the App target:
    - Select an eligible provisioning profile or enable "Automatically
      manage signing".

3. In AppDelegate.m:
    - Enter an app id, app code and license key.

### Without CocoaPods

1. In the "General" settings of the App target:
    - Select an eligible provisioning profile or enable "Automatically
      manage signing".
    - Add NMAKit.framework to the "Embedded Binaries" section otherwise you
      will get a "dyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/NMAKit.framework/NMAKit"
      error at runtime.
 
2. In the "Builds Settings" of the App target:
    - Ensure "Frameworks Search Paths" includes the location of
      NMAKit.framework.
 
3. In AppDelegate.m:
    - Enter an app id, app code and license key.
